# Assessment 1 - Visualising temperature

For the first assessment that's part of the course "Front-end Development 3", I visualised [this](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/blob/master/assessment-1/temperature.csv) dataset.

## Background

## Process

### Picking the dataset

At the start of the assessment, we were able to choose from three different datasets. One in TSV, one in CSV and one in JSON.
I totally ignored the file type, and tried my best to see which data I could be most creative with.

One dataset was about the most spoken languages, the other one about access to indoor toilets.
I must admit that the 'languages' dataset was most appealing to me, since I love languages, but it frightened me. I had the most ideas for this one, but I knew they would be difficult to work out.
The 'toilets' dataset left me without any ideas. The only dataset remaining was the temperature dataset, that's what I went with.

### Deciding on visualisation

To explore visualisation possibilities, I went to the [d3 gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery). I knew that having 100 years worth of data would take more than just a bar chart.
